# bouncingpackets

Contains all of the relevant code I (Max Feinland) wrote for Blum Research Group at LASP. Began migrating to python at the beginning of 2024.

### LEP paper
- Has materials related to the paper *Lightning-induced electron precipitation from the inner radiation belt*, published Oct 2024 in Nat Comms
- Has MATLAB search script and materials to replicate plots from that paper

### variable shapes
- Has materials related to the paper *Variable shapes observed in electron bouncing microburst packets*, submitted to GRL in August 2024
- Has Python search script and materials to replicate plots from that paper (as of Dec 2024 revision)
  
### time evolution
- Has materials for an as-yet unpublished manuscript investigating the evolution of bouncing packet peaks

### modeling?
- Materials for a modeling effort following the "variable shapes" paper
