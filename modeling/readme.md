# This is all still a work in progress

- `rhs_5_v1.csv` has a catalog similar to that in Mike Shumko's github, and is just the O'Brien 2003 criterion run on all the State 4 SAMPEX data with the change of the right-hand side being 5 rather than 10. So it's instances where (N100 - A500)/sqrt(A500 + 1) > 5.
- `make_quicklook_plots.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that uses the catalog `good_events.csv` in the `bouncingpackets/variable shapes/` folder to create quick-look plots. This was done with the intention of modeling.
